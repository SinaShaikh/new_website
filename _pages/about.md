Hi, my name is Sina Shaikh, and I work at MIT in the  
[Elections Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu/). I recently graduated  
*Summa Cum Laude* from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://upenn.edu) with  
a Bachelor of Science in Engineering in computer science and minors in political science and  
survey research and data analytics.  

Over the past few years, I've worked as a research fellow through the  
[Penn Program on Opinion Research and Election Studies (PORES)](https://pores.upenn.edu),  
for the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu),  
for the [Perry World House](https://global.upenn.edu/perryworldhouse),  
as a TA for [CIS 110](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis110/current/) and  
[GAFL 5310](https://catalog.upenn.edu/courses/gafl/), and on the Decision Desk for  
[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com).
