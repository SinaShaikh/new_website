Hi, my name is Sina Shaikh, and I work at MIT in the [Elections Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu/). I recently graduated *Summa Cum Laude* from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://upenn.edu) with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering in computer science and minors in political science and survey research and data analytics.  

Over the past few years, I've worked as a research fellow for the [Penn Program on Opinion Research and Election Studies (PORES)](https://pores.upenn.edu), the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu), the [Perry World House](https://global.upenn.edu/perryworldhouse), the [Computational Social Science Lab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/), and on projects for [Guy Grossman](https://guygrossman.com/) and [Jerry Jacobs](https://sociology.sas.upenn.edu/people/jerry-jacobs). I've also been a TA for [CIS 110](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis110/current/) and [GAFL 5310](https://catalog.upenn.edu/courses/gafl/), tutored for [CRIM 4012](https://catalog.upenn.edu/courses/crim/) and worked on the Decision Desk for [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com).
